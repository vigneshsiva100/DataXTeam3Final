Orbit_ML_DataX.ipynb
The Orbit or Object-Oriented BayesIan Time Series Package utilizes Bayesian Time Series analysis. Through our experimentation of Orbit, we utilized feature engineering to test on 'ALL_INJURIES' and were able to build graphs with confidence bands for our final project.

Prophet_ML_DataX.ipynb
The Prophet Package utilizes an algorithm to generate time series models. Through our experimentation of Prophet, we utilized feature engineering to test on 'ALL_INJURIES' and Fourier Order to determine how quick seasonality can change.
