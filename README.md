# DataXTeam3Final
A ML predictive model of crash data evaluating seasonality, accident factors, and trends. 

Project Folder: DataXTeam3Final

Orbit_ML_DataX.ipynb

The Orbit or Object-Oriented BayesIan Time Series Package utilizes Bayesian Time Series analysis. Through our experimentation of Orbit, we utilized feature engineering to test on 'ALL_INJURIES' and were able to build graphs with confidence bands for our final project.

Prophet_ML_DataX.ipynb

The Prophet Package utilizes an algorithm to generate time series models. Through our experimentation of Prophet, we utilized feature engineering to test on 'ALL_INJURIES' and Fourier Order to determine how quick seasonality can change.


VAR_ML_DataX.ipynb

Vector autoregression (VAR) is used for to capture the relationship among multiple features including 'CRASH_DT', 'K_PEOPLE', 'PERSONS_INJURED',  'PEDESTRIANS_KILLED,' and 'PEDESTRIANS_INJURED.' This is our baseline model to test the best possible fit.
